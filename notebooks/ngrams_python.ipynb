    "\n",
    "Including sentence boundary markers leads to a better model. To do that we need to augment each sentence with a special symbols for beginning and end of sentence tags (`<s>` and `</s>`, respectively). The beginning of the sentence tag gives the bigram context of the first word; and encodes probability of a word to start a sentence. Adding the end of the sentence tag, on the other hand, makes the bigram model a true probability distribution (Jurafsky and Martin). \"Without it, the sentence probabilities for all sentences of a given length would sum to one. This model would define an infinite set of probability distributions, with one distribution per sentence length.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For larger ngrams, we’ll need to assume extra context for the contexts to the left and right of the sentence boundaries. For example, to compute trigram probabilities at the very beginning of the sentence, we can use two pseudo-words for the first trigram (i.e. `['<s>', '<s>', w1]`). Alternatively, we can use [back-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz%27s_back-off_model), and use the `['<s>', w1]` bigram probability. "
